# Virtual reality project


## Description

The project consists of a pool game implemented in C++ and OpenGL. The game therefore obviously includes the essential elements of a pool game, namely: a pool table, a cue and the balls. These elements are arranged in a room, itself covered by a skybox of a street environment. Since the focus was on the graphical aspect of the game, it was decided to keep the game itself simple. Indeed, the game controls available allow to play a solo game by manually performing the game actions usually associated with the pool game, i.e.: enabling/disabling the use of the pool cue, rotating the pool cue, adjusting the shooting power, shooting, resetting the cue ball position and resetting the game.

The main features are the following :  
- A coherent room environment  
- A simple collision system  
- Mirror and windows  
- Bump mapping  
- Shadows  
- Various small mechanics  :
	- Controls for the cue  
	-  A light switch  

## Dependencies and Setup

The project uses the following submodules, included in the `3rdParty` directory.
- [glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/tree/dd8a678a66f1967372e5a5e3deac41ebf65ee127) OpenGL Library
- [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm/tree/fc8f4bb442b9540969f2f3f351c4960d91bca17a) OpenGL Mathematics
- [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb/tree/8b5f1f37b5b75829fc72d38e7b5d4bcbf8a26d55) Image Library

Therefore when cloning (or forking) the repository, use preferably :
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/nicolasseznec/INFO-H502_GroupC_Project.git
```

The project is built using `CMake`.
